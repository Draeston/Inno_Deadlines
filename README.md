# InnoDeadlines
We start working on this project because sometimes face the problem when we just forget
about deadlines and it is hard to find all impotant information related to the assignment in time. 
So, we decided to create the project which will help, we hope, other Innopolis students to manage with their deadlines don't face this problem.
